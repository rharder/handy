# VBA Code

Some useful tidbits that I need to cut and paste here and there.

Also in the Python folder of this repository is some code for extracting VBA code from MS Office documents.  You can extract all the code from files listed on the command line and build a single HTML page that lets you review all the code.  I use this in a VBA course I teach.
